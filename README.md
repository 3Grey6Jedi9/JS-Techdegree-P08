# JS-Techdegree-P08
 My eighth JavaScript Project



CONSIDERATIONS 

A) Project contains at least the following views: layout.pug, index.pug, new-book.pug, update-book.pug, error.pug and page-not-found.pug. 

Comments from Slack: update-book.pug is missing, though you do have a show-book.pug. 

Personal Commets: Considering  my program structure I didn't think that an update-book.pug file was necessary since I am managing that through the
show-book.pug. Moreover, the users see clearly where and how update the book (from my point of view).

B) The CANCEL buttons 

Comments from Slack: One other thing
